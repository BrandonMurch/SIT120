# Tend (Proof of Concept)

This was bootstrapped by @vue/cli. To get started run **npm install**, then run **npm run serve** for the development server, or run **npm run build** for a production version in the dist/ folder. The built version will have to be run using your HTTP server of choice. For example run **serve -s dist**

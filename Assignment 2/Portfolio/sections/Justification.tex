	\chapter{Justification For Grade}
		I will be aiming for a \textbf{High Distinction} grade within this assignment, and also more generally throughout the course. I have done a few MOOC courses relating to web development, and have used similar frameworks to VUE, such as React and Angular. Since I am familiar with these topics, I will use this course to fill in the gaps of knowledge, and focus on the more advanced topics within the course, as well as the more formal proposal process. \\

		I believe that this report reflects my targeted mark. Throughout the 8 weeks so far, my reflections have provided information in different formats (text, rich text and images). I have constantly been looking to outside sources to expand my knowledge of what is taught in class, and offering my findings in detail. In addition, I have included a section at the end this document reserved for useful code snippets. This way when I have come across a problem which I have already solved, there is an easy place I can refresh myself on the correct way to approach the problem. Finally I hope that my report is easily readable for other people, as that has been my goal while writing it.\\
